# RotationalPerturbations

Calculate EMG, CoM kinematics, and ankle angle kinematics in three time zones
= Calculate_Ankle_Zones.m

input:
subj = subject chosen for analysis (e.g., 'TD9')
selection = which trials you want to analyze. We excluded all stepping trials. 
leg = selected leg for analysis (most affected in children with CP, randomly selected in TD children)



Calculate CCI
= CCI_TO.m

Input:
subj = 'CP' or 'TD'
i = number of selected subject
